description: "AI has been described as \"Thor's Hammer\" and \"the new electricity.\" But it's also a bit of a mystery â€“ even to those who know it best. We'll connect with some of the world's leading AI experts to explain how it works, how it's evolving, and how it intersects with every facet of human endeavor. This podcast is produced by NVIDIA, the AI computing company. Multiple episodes are released every month."
