description: "We've entered a new era. The creation and collection of information play an ever-increasing — yet often hidden — role in our lives. Algorithms filter all sorts of experiences, from the mundane to the monumental. The fuel that powers and curates these experiences is…data. Data are the new oil; whoever controls data has power. Is this making things better? Worse? Raw Data is a show about how information becomes power. What are the implications for all of us, now that mountains of data are more accessible and malleable than ever?<br><br>Episodes post on Thursdays. From Stanford and PRX.<br><br>Hosted by Andrea Mustain and Mike Osborne.<br><br>We love hearing from you! Please email us at hello@rawdatapodcast.com"
