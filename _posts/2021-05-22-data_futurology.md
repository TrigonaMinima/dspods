description: "Artificial intelligence is a tremendously beneficial technology that's advancing at an incredibly rapid pace.<br>As more and more organisations adopt and implement AI we find that the main challenges are not in the technology itself but in the human side, ie: the approaches, chosen problems and what's called 'the last mile', etc.<br><br>That's why Data Futurology focuses on the leadership side of AI and how to get the most value from it.<br><br>Join me, Felipe Flores, a Data Science executive with almost 20 years of experience in the space. Every week I speak with top industry leaders from around the world."
