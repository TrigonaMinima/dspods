description: "We started Weights and Biases to build tools for Machine Learning practitioners because we care so much about the impact that Machine Learning can have in the world and we love working in the trenches with the people building these models. One of the most fun things about building these tools has been the conversations with ML practitioners and learning about the interesting things they're working on. This process has been so fun that we decided to open it up to the world and share what everyone is up to. We hope you have as much fun listening to it as we had making it!"
