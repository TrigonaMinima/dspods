description: "Data science is one of the fastest growing industries and has been called the ‘Sexiest job of the 21st Century’. But what exactly is data science? In this podcast, brought to you by DataCamp, Hugo Bowne-Anderson approaches the question by exploring what problems data science can solve rather than defining what data science is. From automated medical diagnosis and self-driving cars to recommendation systems and climate change, come on a journey with experts from industry and academia to explore the industry that will change the course of the 21st century."
