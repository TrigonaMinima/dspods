description: "The incredible advances in machine learning research in recent years often take time to propagate out into usage in the field. One reason for this is that such “state-of-the-art” results for machine learning performance rely on the use of handwritten, idiosyncratic optimizations for specific hardware models or operating contexts. When developers are building ML-powered systems"
